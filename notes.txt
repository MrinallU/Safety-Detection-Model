Bidirectional lstm preforms better on smaller horizons rather than larger 
horizions, this could be because smaller timestep gaps are more dependent on the 
prior 3 seconds on context given. Larger timesteps, on the other hand, have likely 
already stabilized any driving done on the inital data given, making it somewhat unessecary 
for bidirectional context??


Increase epochs to 200 and run.
